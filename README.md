Dedicated to all the physics enthusiasts around the world:  

Physics Virtual Lab Simulations 


About this project:
This is our 8th grade term project[1] repository. We have decided to open our source code for the benefit of our academic community. The simulation website is hosted on Replit[2]. The term project is a group effort with dedicated members including Brandon Wang, Akash Singh, Aditya Arunachalam and Patrick Zhou. The purpose of our project is to integrate our knowledge in both computer science and physics to turn theoretical science[3] into repeatable virtual laboratory simulations[4]. The impact we are hoping to see is that physics students from all corners of the world can use these tools that we have built to perform lab experiments even without the necessary financial means to do so.

Libraries and tools used:
We used only standard web development tools for this project - HTML[5], CSS[6], JavaScript[7]. We refrained from using any other frameworks and libraries for this project because we want to challenge ourselves by forcing the team to develop codes and physics calculation formulas from absolute scratch.

 

Images and Assets used:
Restart System Icon from https://freeiconspng.com

Technologies used:
Visual Studio Code[8] - for code development.
Replit[2] - for website hosting.
Github[9] - for open sourcing and storing codes.
Discord - for team communications.
Google Docs - for writing our term project papers. 

 

Formal Proposal:
Term Project Proposal 


<ul id="termprojectdesc">1. The term project for our school <a href="https://basisindependent.com/">Basis Independent Fremont</a></ul>
<ul id="replitdesc">2. A online ide as well as a community which provides servers for hobby developers to work on. </ul>
<ul id="theoreticaldesc">3. Physics that is not experimental and is not hands on and realistic. </ul>
<ul id="simdesc">4. Models that represent what would truly happen under certain circumstances in real life. </ul>
<ul id="htmldesc">5. HyperText Markup Language is code that would structure the website and is generally considered the skeleton of the website. </ul>
<ul id="cssdesc">6. Cascading Style Sheets is code that would style those elements in the HTML<a href="#htmldesc">[5]</a>. </ul>
<ul id="JSdesc">7. The logic behind websites. This is what manipulates the webpage upon user interaction. </ul>
<ul id="vsdesc">8. An electron app ide that is a top pick for web developers. Brought to us by Microsoft. </ul>
<ul id="ghdesc">9. A code storing platform that allows developers to open source their projects. </ul>
