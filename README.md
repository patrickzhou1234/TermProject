*<div align="center">Dedicated to all the physics enthusiasts around the world: Physics Virtual Lab Simulations </div>*
<br>
Introduction: <br>
This is our 8th grade term project<a href="#termprojectdesc">[1]</a> repository. We have decided to open our source code for the benefit of our academic community. The simulation website is hosted on <a href="https://replit.com">Replit</a><a href="#replitdesc">[2]</a>. The term project is a group effort with dedicated members including Brandon Wang, Akash Singh, Aditya Arunachalam and Patrick Zhou. The purpose of our project is to integrate our knowledge in both computer science and physics to turn theoretical physics<a href="#theoreticaldesc">[3]</a> into repeatable virtual laboratory simulations<a href="#simdesc">[4]</a>. 
<br><br>
Libraries and tools used:<br>
We use standard web development tools for this project - HTML<a href="#htmldesc">[5]</a>, CSS<a href="#cssdesc">[6]</a>, JavaScript<a href="#JSdesc">[7]</a>. We refrained from using any other frameworks and libraries for this project because we want to challenge ourselves by forcing the team to develop codes and physics calculation formulas from absolute scratch.
